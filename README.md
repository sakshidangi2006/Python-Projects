## 🎮 Gameplay Example

```
==================================================
🎮 Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
==================================================

🎯 I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100
🎮 You have 10 attempts to guess it!

🤔 Attempt 1/10 - Enter your guess: 50
📈 Too low! Try a higher number.

🤔 Attempt 2/10 - Enter your guess: 75
📉 Too high! Try a lower number.

🤔 Attempt 3/10 - Enter your guess: 63
📈 Too low! Try a higher number.

🤔 Attempt 4/10 - Enter your guess: 69
==================================================
🎉 Congratulations! You guessed it in 4 attempts!
✨ The number was 69
==================================================

🔄 Do you want to play again? (yes/no): yes
```

## 🎲 Game Rules

1. 🎯 The computer picks a random number between 1 and 100
2. 🔢 You have 10 attempts to guess it
3. 💡 After each guess, you get a hint:
   - 📈 "Too low" - Guess higher
   - 📉 "Too high" - Guess lower
4. 🎉 Win by guessing correctly
5. 😢 Lose if you use all 10 attempts
6. 🔄 Play again as many times as you want!

## 🛠️ Code Structure

```python
# Main Functions
play_game()  # Single game session
main()       # Game loop with replay option
```

**Key Concepts Used:**
- `random.randint()` for number generation
- `while` loops for game logic
- `try-except` for error handling
- Conditional statements for hints

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add difficulty levels (Easy: 1-50, Hard: 1-500)
- [ ] Implement score tracking
- [ ] Add timer/speed bonus
- [ ] Create leaderboard
- [ ] Add hint system (use a hint to narrow range)
- [ ] GUI version with Tkinter
- [ ] Multiplayer mode
- [ ] Save high scores to file

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

- Built as a beginner Python project
- Inspired by classic number guessing games

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Problem: Game closes immediately**
- **Solution:** Run from terminal, not by double-clicking

**Problem: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'random'"**
- **Solution:** `random` is built-in, ensure Python is correctly installed

**Problem: Input errors**
- **Solution:** Enter only numbers between 1-100

**Problem: Want to quit mid-game**
- **Solution:** Press `Ctrl+C` to exit
